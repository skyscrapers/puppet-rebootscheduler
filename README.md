puppet-rebootscheduler
======================
About
-----
To automatically schedule a reboot on Ubuntu systems.

Note:

We use this module on all of our nodes by default with a single configuration. That's why there is an override option to re-schedule or disable the rebootscheduler in accordance with certain SLAs.
